# The battle to run my custom network on a Movidius / Myriad compute stick

This repository hold the code that goes with my blogpost (tbd).

I explain how to transfer a simple example custom model from keras, scikit-learn or pytorch to Movidius Openvino 
Intermediate Representation (IR) format and to run it on the Movidius compute stick.

Installation instructions and the general workflow is given in the blogpost.

Enjoy :)
